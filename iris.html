	<h2>The Iris </h2>
	<img src="images/iris_lg.jpg" alt="White Iris" class="pic-right"> 
	<p>This week's featured flower is the white iris. This flower is white. It's an iris. You can trust me to tell the truth about that.</p>

	<p>It grows in the ground. It blooms in the spring. It's known as a spring bulb. It grows from a bulb and the bulbs multiply and if you aren't careful you'll have a whole field full of iris after a few years, because these bulbs are busy being prolific down there in the dark.</p>

	<p>Don't forget to cut some and take them inside because they smell really nice and they don't make you sneeze all that much.</p>

	<h2>News Items</h2>
	<p>All the latest flower news  goes here. If your site has a blog,  link to the latest blog entry here. Or maybe show some pretty flowers from Flickr.</p>
